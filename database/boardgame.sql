There are so many different ways of ending a game. Some games are played over a fixed number of rounds and others end when a certain goal or goals are achieved. There are also games that have a slightly more random timer. What happens when a game ends is also not always the same. In some games, all players get one more turn or the current round is played out. Other games end immediately and nobody gets another chance. In this article, I want to look at how all of these different endings create different player experiences.</p>\r\n<span id=\"more-12796\"></span><p class=\"box-out\"><img class=\"box-out\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Uncertain-death-Topic-Discussion.jpg\" alt=\"Uncertain death – end game triggers (Topic Discussion) (Photo by Aron Visuals on Unsplash)\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Uncertain-death-Topic-Discussion.jpg\"><span class=\"figcaption\">(Photo by Aron Visuals on Unsplash)</span></p>\r\n<h2>Fixed Number of Rounds</h2>\r\n<p>Let’s look at games where the end of the game is triggered after a fixed number of rounds. In these games, everyone will get the same number of turns. Just think of games such as <em><a href=\"/2022/08/06/sagrada-saturday-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sagrada</a></em> or <em><a href=\"/2022/07/16/aquamarine-saturday-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Aquamarine</a></em>. Nobody can complain that they didn’t see the end coming, especially not if there is a clear round tracker. Everyone should be able to map out how many actions they have and roughly plan what they’ll be able to do from start to finish. I know, most games don’t allow you to plan everything in detail, but at least you do get a sense of what might be possible.</p>\r\n<p>That’s especially useful when you know how many points you’re likely to get from which parts of the game. It also helps if you have a sense of the number of points you’ll have at game end. Dividing the potential points total by the number of rounds or actions gives you a useful average to aim for. It also allows you to track your progress during the game. You will roughly know if you’re ahead or falling behind.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review.jpg\" alt=\"Sagrada\'s translucent,\n        colourful dice on the player board (photo courtesy of Floodgate Games)\" class=\"wp-image-12788\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review.jpg\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review.jpg\" alt=\"Sagrada\'s translucent, colourful dice on the player board (photo courtesy of Floodgate Games)\" class=\"wp-image-12788 ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Sagrada-Saturday-Review-768x576.jpg 768w\"><figcaption>Sagrada’s translucent dice look amazing (photo courtesy of Floodgate Games)</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>So games that end after a fixed number of rounds are pretty predictable and predictability creates a sense of comfort. It’s the unknown people don’t tend to like. As a player, you will know how much longer you have to endure this game, if you don’t get on with it, or how little time you have left to win. On the whole, games with a fixed number of rounds allow you to plan better. They therefore tend to feel more enjoyable.</p>\r\n<h2>Goals and Objectives</h2>\r\n<p>Games that don’t have a fixed number of rounds, but that end when one or more objectives are met, either by a single player or several of them, are a lot less predictable. Games with these sorts of end game triggers include <em><a href=\"/2022/07/23/undaunted-normandy-saturday-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Undaunted: Normandy</a></em> and <em><a href=\"/2022/06/25/adventure-games-the-dungeon-saturday-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Adventure Games: The Dungeon</a></em>.</p>\r\n<p>However, there is still usually a way of working out how close you are to the end of the game. Often you will be able to tell how close to completing a goal players are. So you still get a sense of how much time there is likely left.</p>\r\n<p>There is still more of a sense of surprise when a player, whose goal seemed to be way off completing, pulls off an amazing combo and suddenly finishes the game. Your hope of getting two or three more turns to finish your own goal is dashed. All you can do is try to get as many points as possible to pull into second place.</p>\r\n<p>That level of uncertainty creates excitement and tension. When the tension is suddenly released, it usually creates strong emotions. When everyone is on the edge of their seat and itching to take their turn to finish the game, but someone else gets there first, it’s just glorious. Usually, it creates feelings of joy and happiness, but of course, it can also turn into disappointment. I hope as adults we’ve learned to deal with it, especially in the context of board games.</p>\r\n<h2>Random Timers</h2>\r\n<p>Some games don’t have a fixed number of rounds, but also no specific objectives. Instead, there is some sort of timer. It might be a deck of cards, where the bottom so many cards contain an end-game trigger at a randomly shuffled position, like in <em><a href=\"/2022/01/29/dominant-species-marine-saturday-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dominant Species: Marine</a></em>. Timed games give you a rough idea of when the game is likely to end, but you can never be sure.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10507\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10507 lazyloaded\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Dominant-Species-Marine-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\"></figure>\r\n<p>When these games end, there will be a similar sense of happiness or disappointment, as there is in objective games. The main difference is that nobody will ever get a sense of how close they are to finishing the game. Instead, everyone will hope that the game continues just one more round. Everyone just wants to complete their plans and score a few more points that might clinch victory.</p>\r\n<h2>Finishing the Round</h2>\r\n<p>Irrespective of how end game triggers are decided, there is then still the question of whether the game ends immediately or if the round is finished – or if every player gets one more turn.</p>\r\n<p>If you finish the round or everyone gets more turn, you tend to feel like you at least have another chance at getting a few more points to get to second place. The game sort of gives you a second chance. Some games even have the option of you winning, if you get the most point. You don’t necessarily win just because you’re the first to finish.</p>\r\n<p class=\"ad\">&nbsp;<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-9957990347412489\" data-ad-slot=\"1251699812\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p>\r\n<p>All of these things give you a sense of control. You don’t feel cheated out of victory. You don’t feel like you were unable to see through your plan.</p>\r\n<p>That’s opposed to games that end immediately, like <em><a href=\"/2019/01/19/scythe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scythe</a></em>. Most people think that this sort of ending is unfair. You want to be able to at least have one more turn, just so that you can carry out the actions you had planned for so long and get the points you think you deserve.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><noscript><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-437\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1980x1485.jpg 1980w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></noscript><img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1024x768.jpg\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-437 lazyloaded\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1980x1485.jpg 1980w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_1535-34729843111-1980x1485.jpg 1980w\"><figcaption>Scythe</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Games that end immediately create a sense of resentment and I’ve heard quite often how games groups houserule them to allow everyone on more turn. I think games that end immediately are absolutely fine. As long as you know that’s what happens from the start, you can plan for them.</p>\r\n<h2>What About You?</h2>\r\n<p>As you can see, there are many different ways a game can end. End game triggers vary quite a bit and create quite different gameplay experiences. What do you think about the way games end? How do you feel about different end game triggers? Do you hate it when a game ends suddenly and unexpectedly? Maybe you feel you deserve one more turn? Do you like games that have a fixed number of rounds? As always, please share your thoughts in the comments below.

It was the summer of 1944, but it was relatively cold. We were thousands of miles from home and the landscape was unknown to us. Yet, we had to push deeper into a country we didn’t know in our goal to push the German forces out of France. There was regular machine gun fire and mortar bombardment.

The United States had already lost around 29,000, with a further 106,000 wounded or missing<sup>1</sup>. The losses for the other allied nations weren’t much less. Germany lost 30,000 troops, with 80,000 wounded and 210,000 missing<sup>1</sup>. It was a brutal battle and the largest naval, air and land operation in history<sup>2</sup> – but it was only the beginning. The Landings opened up a much-needed second front against Germany. It took just under a year after the Landings for Germany to surrender<sup>3</sup>.</p>\r\n<p>As everyone knows, WWII saw an unbelievable amount of death, suffering and atrocities. The victory of the Allied Forces over Germany put an end to the Nazis’ Final Solution and lead to the formation of the United Nations<sup>4</sup>. The war saw tens of millions of people being killed, many of whom were civilians who died at the hands of Nazis who persecuted not only Jews, but also many others.</p>\r\n<p>We must never forget the atrocities committed during and just before WWII by the Nazi apparatus.</p>\r\n<h2>The Game</h2>\r\n<p>In <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> you either play as the United States or Germany. You play this game over a number of scenarios that represent different missions carried out by the US 30th Infantry Division. There are a number of double-sided square cardboard tiles that represent sections of terrain. They are set up in different combinations for each scenario. You also get two decks of cards, one for the US and one for Germany and a large number of different cardboard tokens. These represent objectives, troops and other elements in the game. There are also four 10-sided dice, which you use during attacks and which make this process a little more random.</p>\r\n<p>The main mechanisms in <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> are hand management and deck building. Every scenario starts with a different selection of cards, based on the mission played. You divide these cards further into your deck and your supply. Like in any other deck-building game you will have played, you shuffle your deck at the beginning of the game. Every round you then draw a number of cards into your hand, four in this case. You play these in any order you want on your turn and then discard them in your discard pile.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy cards\" class=\"wp-image-12634\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy cards\" class=\"wp-image-12634 lazyloaded\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\"><figcaption>Undaunted: Normandy cards</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>Every card has a number of actions on them and you choose one of them as you play the card. Some actions allow you to take cards out of your supply and add them to your discard pile. That’s where the “building” part comes in. You can also remove useless cards, called Fog of War cards in the game, with certain actions, which allow you to thin out your deck.</p>\r\n<h3>Move and Attack</h3>\r\n<p>Most of the time though you will want to scout the map and move your troops around – or you will choose to attack. </p>\r\n<p>You can only move onto tiles that you have scouted out. So you need to move your scout units first, before you can move your other military units. However, the more tiles you scout, the more Fog of War cards you get. That represents the idea that your troops are now more spread out and therefore communication is becoming more difficult.</p>\r\n<p>Attack is a matter of counting the terrain tiles between your unit and the target unit, then adding the defending unit’s defence value and the cover value of the tile the defending unit is on. So a wooded area may offer a cover value of 3, while an open field has a value of 0. You then roll a number of dice, depending on your unit and the type of attack you’re carrying out. If at least one of the dice is equal to or higher than the defence value of the unit you’re attacking, or if you’ve rolled at least one 0, then your attack was successful.</p>\r\n<p>There are different types of attack, as I mentioned. You can literally try to kill someone or you can just lay down suppressive fire. The former is harder, but if successful, the other player will have to remove a card from the game. The latter is easier, but only slows down your opponent. Their unit is considered “suppressed”. That means when they’re next used, they just become active again, but don’t carry out any actions.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy suppressed unit\" class=\"wp-image-12635\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20600%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy suppressed unit\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-12635\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"><figcaption>Undaunted: Normandy suppressed unit</figcaption></figure>\r\n<h3>Strategy and Tactics</h3>\r\n<p>It is amazing how different every scenario in <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> is. Depending on which side you play and what the current mission is, you may just want to lay down suppressive fire to slow down the opponent while you slowly build up your own hand. If you time it right, you can then strike with full force when you’re ready. In other missions, you just have to try and rush a win and hope for the best. There are also scenarios where you start out in the open. You quickly have to find cover, before you can co-ordinate an attack. You really have to spend a little time at the beginning of each game evaluating the map and your objectives, before deciding the best plan of action.</p>\r\n<p>Some scenarios look like they’re heavily weighted towards one side rather than the other. It feels unfair. However, as you start playing, you realise that the perceived benefit isn’t actually as big as you thought. With some clever manoeuvring you quickly outflank the other player and claim the objective points you need to win.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of objective points, many scenarios’ goal is to basically conquer specific locations and control them to win. However, there is also always the option to destroy your enemy’s riflemen units. Winning that way is called pinning, because it’s only the riflemen who can control a location. So if you can’t control locations, you can never claim the objective points you need to win. It’s something to bear in mind and can be the better option in some cases.</p>\r\n<h3>Suprise Victory</h3>\r\n<p><em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> sometimes feels like it will never end. Both sides have found their perfect cover and have dug themselves in. There seems to be an endless exchange of fire that slowly whittles down both players’ forces. You are about to offer a draw, when you suddenly spot an opportunity – or maybe your opponent sees something you’ve missed.</p>\r\n<p>Quite often the game ended suddenly, at a point when it felt like it could continue for another half hour or more. I was often really surprised. I sometimes felt that sudden victory was just a matter of being lucky with my card draw or that the other player just had had bad luck. Other times I felt like I had found the perfect moment to strike and gained a deserved victory. In most cases, one player simply didn’t see the opportunity their opponent had and left themselves wide open.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy units\" class=\"wp-image-12636\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20600%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy units\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-12636\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-3-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"><figcaption>Undaunted: Normandy units</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p><em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> is really clever in that respect. You always have to make sure you’ve covered your bases. It’s easy to be lulled into a false sense of security. If you take your eye off the situation for a round, your opponent could get the opportunity they need to win.</p>\r\n<p>You also need to keep an eye on the cards the other player has in their deck and which they have played. More often than not, you can use your own cards in a much better way if you know that the other player no longer has certain cards in their draw deck. It’s very much like most deck builders in that respect.</p>\r\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\r\n<p>Placing a game against the backdrop of one of the bloodiest and most brutal wars in history is never easy. Focussing on a smaller section of WWII does make it a little easier. As the rulebook says “<em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> is based heavily on the US Army rifle platoons of World War II and<br>more specifically on the actions of the US 30th Infantry Division in Normandy from 10 June<br>to 13 August 1944.” However, as players, you’re still faced with re-enacting the killing of people in battle. That’s not something that’s easy to accept.</p>\r\n<p class=\"flat ad\" style=\"margin-bottom:20px!important\">&nbsp;<a href=\"https://l.linklyhq.com/l/1K7gu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><video autoplay=\"\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" style=\"width:100%;height:auto\"><source src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ezgif.com-gif-maker.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></a></p>\r\n<p><em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> tries to remind players that there were real people in this war. The cards show names of soldiers “to add to the sense that you are in command of real soldiers and not pure abstractions”, as the rulebook points out. They are not necessarily names of some of the people who actually fought in the campaigns that the game’s scenarios represent, but “have been generated from names that were common in the period and are not meant to refer to any person, living or dead.”</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy cards with names\" class=\"wp-image-12637\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20800%20600%22%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4.jpg\" alt=\"Undaunted: Normandy cards with names\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-12637\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undaunted-Normandy-Saturday-Review-illu-4-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"><figcaption>Undaunted: Normandy cards with names</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>There are very few war games that really bring the brutality of war to life. In most war games, players are distanced from the death and suffering of people and <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> is no different. Removing cards from play or taking tokens off the board doesn’t convey any sense of someone losing their life.</p>\r\n<h3>Fog of War</h3>\r\n<p>At the same time, you do get a small sense of the panic and chaos that can reign on the battlefield. As the commander, you know exactly what you want to happen next, but when you draw your next hand of cards, you don’t always get the option to execute your plan. It doesn’t get any easier when more Fog of War cards are added to your deck, reducing your options even further.</p>\r\n<p>As you play, you do feel the helplessness that the commanders must have felt as they watched their troops being killed, without any hope of being able to help them. Of course, that is no replacement for feeling the actual horror of war. <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em>‘s rulebook concurs by saying that “the core mechanic of deck-building is an obvious abstraction […] and the core aim has always been to create a game that might emulate the experience of being in command of a platoon rather than its exact reality.”</p>\r\n<h3>A Great Experience</h3>\r\n<p>Bearing all of this in mind, <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> does not convey the horrors of war, but as a tactical war game is a great experience. It is almost like a traditional tabletop skirmish game, but in board game form. Other than counting tiles and adding cover values, there is no measuring or endless dice rolling. People who are familiar with deck-building games will find it easy to learn <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em>.</p>\r\n<p>There are a lot of facets that make this game attractive to a wide range of players. Tabletop skirmish players will enjoy it as much as fans of deck-building games. War gamers get a nice challenge and are able to imagine themselves as commanders in WWII. At the same time, the experience is really streamlined and requires just enough tactical thinking to keep you busy, without making the game feel drawn out. Setup can take a while, but the gameplay itself is really streamlined and turns are over pretty quickly.</p>\r\n<p>Every scenario takes about an hour to play and in that relatively short amount of time, you will have a satisfying experience. The large number of scenarios also slowly introduce you to new mechanisms, so you can really learn the game as you play.</p>\r\n<p>I know there are now many games in the <em>Undaunted</em> series and more are coming out soon, but I can confidently say that starting with <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> is a good option. If you like this game, then you’ll want to try one of the others. Personally, I got my eye on <em>Undaunted: Stalingrad</em> which introduces even more mechanisms and concepts, creating more of a legacy game experience. Anyway, please give <em>Undaunted: Normandy</em> a try and see where it takes you.</p>\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-greentreelabs-post-snippets-block\"><div style=\"margin:10px 0 10px 0;padding:20px 20px

When you find one you like, you will want them all. Every game comes in a wonderfully small cardboard box that fits nicely into your handbag or jacket pocket and that is easy to take out and about with you. Most games don’t take up a lot of table space either and can be played virtually anywhere. The components are always gorgeous and have a certain Japanese feel about them. They are also easy to explain and learn and quick to play. They’re just wonderful.</p>\r\n<p><em>Town 66</em> is no different, of course. The box is packed to the brim with components: four wooden tile racks, for your cardboard tiles and a lovely little black cloth bag to hold the tiles and from which you draw. There are also a number of rules leaflets in different languages. <em>Oink Games</em> rules can sometimes read a bit odd. I assume they were translated by someone who doesn’t speak English natively. However, as you start playing the game, your questions will be answered. It’s all pretty straightforward.</p>\r\n<h2>2D Puzzle</h2>\r\n<p><em>Town 66</em> is basically a 2D puzzle. Together we build a town in the middle of the table. On your turn, you place one of your titles horizontally or vertically adjacent to a tile that’s already out. However, your tile cannot be the same colour or shape of another tile in the same row and column. It all starts out quite simple, but about halfway through, it gets a lot trickier.</p>\r\n<p>When you play the game for the first time, you won’t understand why you have four tiles to choose from. It seems like way too much choice. Two tiles seem more than enough. So you merrily get rid of one of your tiles and reduce your hand size. After all, the aim of the game is to have the least tiles at the end. It seems obvious that you discard your tiles as quickly as possible.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" alt=\"four tiles from Town 66  arranged in a square\" class=\"wp-image-12877\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg\" alt=\"four tiles from Town 66  arranged in a square\" class=\"wp-image-12877 lazyloaded\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-1-768x576.jpg 768w\"><figcaption>It starts easy…</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>That all changes as more tiles are played into the middle. Suddenly you wish you had more choice and kept some of the tiles you so greedily put back into the bag earlier. The two tiles you have in front of you clearly aren’t very helpful. You might scrape by and manage to place one of the tiles and then you desperately draw up again, hoping that you get a more useful tile.</p>\r\n<p>I would say it takes a whole game before people realize what is expected of them. <em>Town 66</em> is a bit counter-intuitive in the sense that the game wants you to reduce your hand size, but at the same time, you need to hang onto your tiles so you can still place one on your turn. You need to choose the right moment when it is safe to put tiles back into the bag and limit your choices.</p>\r\n<h2>Push Your Luck</h2>\r\n<p>So ultimately, <em>Town 66</em> is a push-your-luck game. Not only do you want to end up with the fewest tiles, but you also want to stay in the game for as long as possible. Sure, the strategy of getting rid of all of your tiles as quickly as possible and then hoping that nobody else can get rid of theirs is valid and I’ve seen it succeed on quite a few occasions. However, it’s risky and you’re usually better off playing for longer and only slowly reducing your hand of tiles.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, you see other players getting rid of their tiles and you feel the pressure mounting to do the same. You have to stand strong though and pick the moment that’s right for you. After all, the other players may just have bad tiles and take the opportunity to get rid of them early. On the other hand, maybe they are confident that they can empty their hand while no one else can.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg\" alt=\"four tiles from Town 66 on their wooden rack in the foreground and three tiles on the table in the background\" class=\"wp-image-12879\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></noscript><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg\" data-src=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg\" alt=\"four tiles from Town 66 on their wooden rack in the foreground and three tiles on the table in the background\" class=\"wp-image-12879 lazyloaded\" data-srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2.jpg 800w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tabletopgamesblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Town-66-Saturday-Review-illu-2-768x576.jpg 768w\"><figcaption>Keep your choices open…</figcaption></figure>\r\n<p>There really is no right or wrong in <em>Town 66</em>. Every game is different. In some games you just have to reduce your hand and hope for the best, while other times you have an unlucky draw and can’t place any tiles. You think it’s all over because you’re out of the game and still holding a bunch of tiles. You think you’re going to lose, when it turns out that nobody else can play their tiles either and you just happen to have been lucky to get rid of one of your tiles while nobody else had – and you win.</p>\r\n<p class=\"ad\">&nbsp;<ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-9957990347412489\" data-ad-slot=\"1251699812\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"></ins><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></p>\r\n<h2>Highs and Lows</h2>\r\n<p>You really can go through a game of <em>Town 66</em> and experience all the highs and lows.

It’s that addictive.</p>\r\n<p>So if you want a quick, fun-filled, exciting 2D puzzle with push-your-luck, then <em>Town 66</em> is definitely for you.

Non-Spy players want to ask questions and give answers that prove to the other players that they know where they are. But watch out! If your questions and answers are too specific, the Spy will easily guess the location and win, so you need to practice a bit of subtlety. But if your questions and answers are too generic, you might be accused of being the Spy. The Spy will also sometimes be asked questions (just like any other player would) and have to come up with questions of his own, without knowing anything about where he is! If you listened carefully to the other players, you\'ll be able to come up with a plausible question or answer... hopefully.<br /><br />Once per round, each player may accuse another player of being the Spy. If all players agree, the game ends and that player\n\'s secret card is flipped up. If the Spy is captured, each of the Non-Spy players win the round. If a Non-Spy is revealed, the Spy wins. Finally, if the Spy figures out where he is, he can reveal his card and make a guess. If he\'s right, he wins the round.

Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\'s too late. Secret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre. The first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\n\'s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team. The second new mechanic is the &quot;Hitler&quot; identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\' trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately.

It\n\'s the Vikings\' last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin\n\'s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfil quests, increase your clan\'s stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarok, the ultimate inescapable doom. Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages). These &quot;Gods\n\' Gifts&quot; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner. Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents\' strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponents\n\' actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed.

Depending on a particular character\'s statistic, combat will deal a specific amount of damage, or players will roll dice, hoping for the ever delightful Critical Hits (ever delightful if they appear on the dice you are rolling!).<br /><br />Earth Reborn includes a range of skill areas, statistics and abilities beyond Moving, Close Combat and Shooting. Players can Search and Interact, and individual characters will have their own special skills, that add a dynamic and interesting set of options to the game. Since Earth Reborn is scenario based these\n\'other\' areas become key aspects of satisfying a mission objective.<br /><br />As players play through the scenarios of Earth Reborn, they will be introduced to more and more layers of the game system. The final scenarios include the full rules system in all its glory. We\n\'ve been teasing this game for the last few issues, and we are very excited now it\'s getting close to release!

Full-color charts and beautiful pictures make this the most readable of rulebooks - and includes a full-service index as well for quick reference.</p>\n<p>And <strong>ASL</strong> is more than &quot;squads&quot; - the system includes the rules for everything from machine guns to bazookas, tanks and ordnance weapons, paratrooper drops, glider landings and beach assaults. And much more. This set of rules is constantly kept up to date by expansions included with the modules.</p>\n<p><strong>ASL</strong> goals are scenario-defined, and vary from tasks such as exiting troops off of one edge of the board, to inflicting a certain number of casualty points on the opposing force, to capturing a certain number of goal buildings or areas.</p>\n<p>This is just the rulebook. To start playing the game the newcomer must get, at least, the Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1. There are a great many ASL Modules available. &quot;Core Modules&quot; provide additional rules, units from different nationalities, and additional geomorphic mapboards. &quot;Historical Modules&quot; provide campaign games simulating multi-day battles using actual historical maps rather than geomorphic mapboards, including additional rules, counters, and paper maps. Many modules have dependencies on earlier modules.</p>\n<p>Rulebook contents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction</li>\n<li>Chapters A, B, C, D, H (Design Your Own, German &amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J [1st edition]</li>\n<li>Chapters A, B, C, D, E, H (Design Your Own, German &amp; Russian vehicle notes only), J, K [2nd edition]</li>\n<li>Index &amp; Glossary</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>1st edition</strong> additional changes/chapters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chapter E in Yanks: ASL Module 3</li>\n<li>chapter F in West of Alamein: ASL Module 5</li>\n<li>chapter G in Code of Bushido: ASL Module 8 / Gung Ho!: ASL Module 9</li>\n<li>chapter K in Paratrooper: ASL Module 2</li>\n<li>8 revised RuleBook pages [A 17-18/A 29-30/B 31-32/F 1-2 all marked &quot;92&quot;] in Croix de Guerre: ASL Module 10</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>2nd edition</strong> additional chapters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>chapter G in Rising Sun: ASL Module 13</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Pocket edition:</strong></p>\n<p>By taking advantage of Print On Demand technology, MMP has produced a softcover version of the 2nd edition ASL rulebook.
